This repostory is for explaining the Firebase Remote Config Tutorial. That how we could use it

In this code, I have implemeted Firebase Remote Config to force user update the app. 
So, we first put the latest app version code in Firebase Remote Config Console and then fetch it values and compare it with the current version of app.
If the current version code of app is less than the fetched app version code then we show an alert dialog asking for user to update the app.

You can find the complete tutorial about what is Firebase Remote Config and how we can implement it in Android?

Thanks
